            <br><br>
            This is where it all started. Based on a 1991 novel by Japanese author Koji Suzuki, this 1998 adaptation 
            (also known as Ring) from Japan’s legendary Toho Studios broke through as an international hit and started 
            the phenomenon known as “J-horror,” as more genre films from that country—along with South Korea and Hong 
            Kong—brought a much-needed jolt of dread, terror, and supernatural menace to a field that had been saturated
             with slasher films and post-modern self-commentary.
            <br><br>
            Directed by Hideo Nakata, Ringu ingeniously blended folklore with (then) modern technology as a cursed videotape brings 
            death within seven days to whoever views it. It may not be what we mean now by “viral video,” but the conceit, along with
            some truly eerie imagery, captured the imaginations of audiences everywhere and sparked a wave of English-language remakes.
            Nearly 25 years later, the original film still packs a wallop, right down to its genuinely nerve-shattering climax, and its
            confluence of old and new horror tropes remains unique.
