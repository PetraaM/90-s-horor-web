            One aspect of the movies based on Stephen King’s work is that they’ve often given meaty parts to actresses
             who then knock those roles out of the park—even to the point of Oscar recognition. Both Sissy Spacek and 
             Piper Laurie were nominated for their work in 1976’s Carrie, but Kathy Bates brought it all the way home 
             when she won the Oscar for Best Actress as the psychopathic Annie Wilkes in this, Rob Reiner’s adaptation 
             of one of King’s most compact yet punchy novels.

             Annie’s favorite author is Paul Sheldon (James Caan, also superb),
            who has just capped off his long-running series of romance novels starring the title character. Luckily for him, 
            Annie saves his life when his car crashes on a snowy road near her house. Not so luckily, Annie is enraged when she 
            learns that Paul has killed off Misery. So she decides to keep him captive until he writes the character back to life. 
            The battle of wits between the two is riveting, along the story’s wry commentary on obsessive fans (30 years before we 
            even had terms like “toxic fandom”), keeping this solidly in the top tier of King adaptations.
