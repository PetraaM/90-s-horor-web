                After crawling around in the foundations of meta-horror with New Nightmare, Wes Craven built his dream 
                house via Scream—which means it’s still a pretty bleak place to hang out in. Just ask the smartass teenagers 
                in this ‘90s touchstone. The kids are all right with being highly media literate, and quite loquacious too thanks
                 to dialogue written by Kevin Williamson. But that doesn’t stop them from being sliced up by a slasher movie killer
                who acts like a clumsy modern day Michael Myers.
                <br><br>
                The movie that brought back slasher horror in a big way, Scream acts like a time capsule now, immortalizing a pop 
                culture moment where the colors were bright, the snark was high, and even being the target of a masked killer didn’t 
                mean you couldn’t have fun with friends at a party and a good bop. The meta-references is what folks remember, but a 
                large reason this movie works is a bubbly cast that held the series together better than any single mask or kill scene. 
                With that said, few horror movies have had openings as gut-wrenching as the one between Drew Barrymore and Roger L. 
                Jackson’s not-so-friendly voice on a phone.
